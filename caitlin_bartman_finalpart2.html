        <b>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</b> <br>I took a class using Javascript about 2 years ago, and I knew some minimal things about HTML. I didn't know anything about CSS and wasn't sure how multiple languages could be brought together to create something between them. <br>
        <b>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</b> <br>I built it mostly from scratch, but I looked at a website to figure out how to make the top menu pages change color/style when you hover over them or click them. <br>
        <b>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</b> <br>The most challenging part was figuring out how to get my text formatting to fit between the two flower borders on my background image. <br>
        <b>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </b> <br> I am majoring in computer science in college next year, and I took this class to get more experience and to figure out more of what I want to do within that major. I am still not entirely sure what I want to do within that field, but I want to take more web development classes since I found the class pretty interesting. <br>
        <b>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</b> <br>I recommend looking at the assignments at the beginning of each week since they tend to vary in length and difficulty, and starting them before the day of the due date since it can get pretty stressful. It is also very helpful to ask questions, and it is best to ask those earlier in the week so that you have time to figure everything out before the assignment is due.<br>
