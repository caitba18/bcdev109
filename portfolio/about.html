		<p>My name is Caitlin Bartman. I attend Bellevue College as a running start student and am in my senior year of highschool. After I graduate highschool, I will be attending Marist College in New York. I am planning to major in computer science and minor in cybersecurity at Marist, and I am also committed to the D1 women's rowing team there. <br>Outside of school and rowing, I write poetry and like reading. I also really love discovering new music and going to concerts, and my favorite band is Joywave (the song on this page is called The Stroke of Return by Joywave).</p>
