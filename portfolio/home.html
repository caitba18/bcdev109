		<p>Welcome to my portfolio! <br>This website is a final project for my DEV109 Intro to Web Development course at Bellevue College. It includes a few pages with information on me personally, such as my goals and interests. It also includes some of my coursework at Bellevue College along with the things that I have done during this course. The initial version of this portfolio was created around in early February 2024 in order to show my work within this course and make a cohesive set of webpages to show my knowledge.</p>
