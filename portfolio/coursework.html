			<p>Course #1: ECON&201 <a href = "https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=12&coid=48315" target="_blank">Microeconomics</a> 
			<br>Instructor: Ty Saxon <br>I took this class fall quarter of the 2023-2024 year, and I didn't really know anything about economics or the effects of the US economic system before taking it. This class helped me learn about different types of economic systems and the benefits and detriments of each. It also had a pretty strong focus on how capitalism affects the relationship between the worker and the business owner, which was interesting to me. It also helped me understand the necessity of having unions in the workplace and how working together can accomplish a lot more than most people might think.</p>
